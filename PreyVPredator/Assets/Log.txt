mutability = 0.01f
Successfully simulating prey and predator with a single fully connected layer with linear activation.
Prey tend to herd together. Predators wander around and sometimes hone in on prey.
I think since the map is too small, this behavior is rewarded.
Also, when at max population, it is random who births next. This doesn't reward the best.
